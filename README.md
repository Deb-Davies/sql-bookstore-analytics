## 🧠 Overview

Imagine you're a data analyst for a small online bookstore. Your manager wants insights into:

- Which customers spend the most?
- What books are selling best?
- How much revenue is generated daily?

This project answers these questions using **SQL only** — no external tools, no visualization libraries — just pure querying logic.

## 🗃️ Database Schema

The database consists of 3 related tables: `books`, `customers`, and `orders`.
